Motivation
==========

There are a lot of embedded GNU/Linux servers and gadgets in my home network.I have created the network diagram with `sphinxcontrib-nwdiag <http://blockdiag.com/en/nwdiag/sphinxcontrib.html>`_ by hand. This is a very tedious task. I want to generate the diagram and discover the nodes.

About Komame
============

``Komame`` is my cat name, she is `Chartreux <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartreux>`_. `My gravator image <http://gravatar.com/mkouhei>`_ is her face photo.
Also ``Komame`` is the meaning of ``frequently`` in Japanese. My cat ``Komame`` is looking around frequently for food in the house. This project has been entangled in such her name.
